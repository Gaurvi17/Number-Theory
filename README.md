 >> proof of correctness of sqrt solution:
    say a*b=n and if a<=sqrt(n) then one can infer easily that b>=sqrt(n)
    therefore we only check till sqrt(n), as the remaining portion remains obvious .
    This not only reduces the time complexity but also gives an edge to our question over other solutions.
